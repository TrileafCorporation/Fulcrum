In order to get this to run, you'll have to get your .env variables setup, add the photos folder to app->utils and install node_modules. Those two are included in .gitignore for decreased project size on GitHub, and security reasons.

Also, actual files in the photos folder are ignored, not the folder itself for storage purposes.
